Speaker 1:          This call is now being recorded. Okay. So can you please tell me your age? Okay. I mean, what's the location?

Speaker 2:          Boise. Idaho.

Speaker 1:          Okay. And what are the smart devices do you have in your property?

Speaker 2:          I have a Honeywell wifi thermostat, the Yale deadbolt lock and blink cameras outside.

Speaker 1:          Okay. And who stole all of these universes?

Speaker 2:          I myself.

Speaker 1:          Okay. So you didn't know about all of them to install them?

Speaker 2:          Yes.

Speaker 1:          Okay. And for how long you are using all these directions?

Speaker 2:          I would say the longest is three years and the shortest is

Speaker 1:          Mmm. Okay, so three years is which one?

Speaker 2:          The Honeywell wifi thermostat.

Speaker 1:          And can you start from the top and tell me like why you are using each of these devices? Let's start with the oldest one. The Honeywell one.

Speaker 2:          Um, I felt like I needed to and since it was available, I felt like I needed to, if a guest last and you know, less the air conditioner on, on, you know, 50 or less, the heat on, I wouldn't necessarily know about it until [inaudible] uh, you know, a long time after the fact. Then I installed the blink cameras after that,

Speaker 1:          then I'll finish the uh, Thomas. So like, do you, can the guest have any control over that or you control everything?

Speaker 2:          Yes, they can control the thermostat once they're in the house, but I can, I can monitor it, I can monitor it and I don't do anything while guests are there. But while guests are not there, um, I turn off the system. I, I turn on the system. I can, I turn it on when like a guest is arriving. If for example, it was long, um, or I just the temperature it may be because of the weather.

Speaker 1:          Okay. So like, um, [inaudible] are like kind of misusing the condition for example, like if they're going too low or too high,

Speaker 2:          there has been occasions that it can happen. Yes. And I have, I have notifications but up so that I'm able to, it notifies me when the temperature is like too high or too low from what I found. Um, yes and no. Um, I have turned it off or turned it on. Like, for example, they turned on the air conditioner and the air conditioner fuse is not even working cause it's winter, so there's no need for their muster. So I turned it off. Okay. Um, but if I get a notification, which I have that the temperature is like super hot in the house, I kind of take notice and, but I won't necessarily behind their back turn it off. Mmm. There's other factors that may contribute to a high temperature, like the fireplace, I give them the benefit of the doubt, but they can set it to, they can turn off, I have a schedule [inaudible] and they can and the change that temperature or they can put it on a hold of some kind where it's, it's always set at a certain temperature versus at the schedule that I set. Um, most of the time the schedule that I have is sufficient for most guests. Um, sometimes they just change it or if there's a lot of them, then I think that the temperature gets changed because a lot more people in the house then a lot more heat or vice versa. So I just, I contributed to that. I don't honestly know since I [inaudible] and just assuming that's what happens with guests, but I, I've never actually asked them, so I'm assuming. Okay.

Speaker 2:          Uh, so the blank cameras, they're from Amazon, Amazon company. Um, I installed them. I have one in the backyard and one in the front yard. Um, I use I for security. Mmm. For security mainly. Um, Oh. And also for, I don't know the right word. Liability. Um, yes. And if guests are valid. Okay. And that's kind of the biggest, one of the biggest reasons I originally sucked them in because not only for the guests, but I also had an not unkind neighbor. Okay. So, um, I was being threatened. Um, and so that was a big push for the cameras, but also because there is a lot of lying that happens and you know, they'd book two guests and they bring five. Yeah. There's lots of people coming over. I mean, there's a lot of lying going on, so I hate to say it.

Speaker 2:          Yes. Makes sense. Two terminals. Uh, yes. I get notifications for any like movement or sound. Okay. Yeah. You can, um, it is not two way. I don't, I don't have that feature. I can get that feature. I do not have it where I can talk back, but I do not, I don't feel like I need it, but triggered. Uh, so any emotion or sound is triggered and the cameras go off. So like everything has to look very, nobody has to like walking along the, uh, yeah. I mean, it's been triggered by the wind. It's been triggered by snow. It's been triggered by world.

Speaker 2:          It depends if you can set it for sensitivity. So can you hear the words, the words that I'm saying? Yes, not, I mean, it's only a very small snippet. It will record for 10 seconds. Oh, okay. I have audio. Yes. Okay. Okay. And, um, I hope we get to, are we gonna get to concern for these devices? Uh, w what do you mean? Are we going to get to concerns of freezers that we don't like them as I'm bleeding? Yeah. Even talk about that. Oh, I just want to mention that the blink cameras, um, from Amazon, um, even though I think they're great product, um, everything they do is great. They have a horrible mounting feature, so, um, they have no security. They do not have a lock box. You cannot buy one. I've fought and fought and fought for almost two years now trying to figure out ways to securely Mount them outside so that they don't walk off.

Speaker 2:          So that's a huge, huge problem of mine. And that's a huge, I hate that fat, that issue. But, um, I've been trying everything under the sun and I will, I try, I've tried multiple things that they make, but, um, most aspects that they just don't make anything that is a secure, like a lock box or, you know, something that the camera fits into that is secure. So it doesn't, it doesn't, you know, it's secured to wherever you mounted. So even though, Oh, and the other feature about that is with my wifi, it is hooked up to my wifi in the house, but the blink cameras run off of a hub, which is fun. It comes with it. Um, so you, so a concern, another concern of mine is that I have, I have this hub that is plugged into an outlet in my app. Yeah. And [inaudible] aye. It has to stay plugged in so that it can run off of the wifi. Well, if any of those factors get unplugged, they don't work. Yeah. So yes, the wifi can get unplugged, which, knock on wood, I've never had a guest do that. Um, I will get notices if the wifi goes out. Um, well if there's a problem or something, usually both the cameras and the thermostat will notify me. But if somebody unplugged that hub, then I could be out. Both cameras.

Speaker 2:          They are, they're connected to wifi. They're all wifi. I do, I get an email, I get an email thing. That's what I'm thinking. Uh, it, it's triggered by like, all of a sudden they'll say, it says your cameras aren't sending. It doesn't say you don't have an internet accident. It just says there's a problem with your cameras.

Speaker 1:          Okay. Then maybe I'm only sending, yeah. So you're concerned about the physical security of the devices, but do you have any concern about the data security, like hello video feeds and everything is not, is it, is it accessible by anyone else on North [inaudible]?

Speaker 2:          I mean some aspects of it either. I suppose I can always do better, but so far, um,

Speaker 1:          you haven't fixed anything.

Speaker 2:          Um, I mean I've recorded things that I needed to record and save them because I needed to because could be a problem. Um, but no, I haven't felt like Mmm. I mean I, the snippets are just snippets and I can, I can adjust that. I have the ability to lengthen the time it record, but it's a matter of battery life and being able to access that data. So, um, I suppose it always can be better, but it has, it's worked for now.

Speaker 1:          Okay. That makes sense. Do you have anything else thing?

Speaker 2:          No, I mean, I just think for as a, as an Airbnb, I, I run that risk of leaving the hub there. And I do have the stipulation in the listing that says after they book, if cause you have to disclose your cameras outside, which I do and I say, is there any, the equipment is disrupted in any way, then you will be charged security deposit. I have never had to do that. Never had to enforce that. But, and I don't know if that, okay.

Speaker 1:          Yeah. Hopefully [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          yeah. Would go well or it would go badly. I don't know. Um, but you know, you're, we're not allowed to have any Mmm. Camera's inside. So there are not any cameras in Zayde. I, I don't think I would, would want them anyway, but if, and most places do old cameras, so, Mmm. I've stayed at Airbnb that have cameras, but Mmm. You know, it, but I mean, it's, it's fair to have it as the host, I think. So, um, you know, not to mess with them, but being a host, I see them in other places and know that they have the right to be there. So I have a different view on it.

Speaker 2:          I have a Yale lock. What is that? It's a Yale. It's like PLS in the school. Um, like the brands. Um, it is wifi enabled deadbolt. Okay. I previously had a key pad where I was able to program in so many um, numbers and I would give each guest with different number. Um, but the fact of the matter is is that you're not able truly if a guest one of the come back and try to get in good because only I can delete those codes. So I have a Yale lock that now it's completely wifi enabled, which does also have a hub that is plugged in in the house that is also hidden or I try to hide it, um, that I am able to make up a new code for each guest. I'm able to say when the time that code works and it does not work.

Speaker 2:          Um, which has been a yes, I can, I can not do that, but I can absolutely do that. I can actually, this enables me to send the guests, I could send a guest an email, um, that means they would have to put the app on their phone, yada, yada, yada. So I don't do that, but it actually is a ensured that I can use. But I have made up a new code for every guest. I'm able to discontinue that code if need be. Um, I haven't had to do that before, but I know people who have. Mmm. And then I'm able to, you know, reset to a new code for the next death. Um, I'm able to lock and unlock the house from my phone wherever I am. Okay. Uh, yes, they, so it's just a deadbolt and then door knob stays open all the time. You can't lock it if you locked it, you couldn't get in. Mmm. And then I also, so I send them hours before their arrival. I send them. Mmm. The door code and the garage code.

Speaker 1:          Okay. And what else do you have?

Speaker 2:          That's it.

Speaker 1:          Okay. Just this tree. There's pretty, pretty low tech actually. I think

Speaker 2:          pretty what? I didn't hear you.

Speaker 1:          Uh, I think it's like you're, uh, moving pretty low tech stuff maybe because that infuses the dependability, like nothing can go wrong in the street.

Speaker 2:          Um, yes and no. Well, I mean it's a security feature and I have the rights to do check on my house. So when I didn't have it, I had to go off their words and so much of that is not true, so. Mmm. Yeah. So I mean this is just another way of hopefully keeping things safe and you know, making mash or my house to safe. Okay. Okay. That's fine. I'm mainly, because I don't live there. I only lived in like once a month. Um, so I'm not living there and I'm renting it out, so me not being there, you know, is a big factor.

Speaker 1:          Yeah. That's happened. So my next question is, do you face any challenges when using these devices? Uh, you told me about the physical, the physical cage kind of thing that you're searching for, but is there any tools?

Speaker 2:          Um, I would say yes, the security of the cameras and the hubs in the house then having, yeah, they may be wireless, but you still have to have that to make it work. So in hopes that people don't turn around and steal it, um, as people do weird things. And the other part is it can be quite intrusive. Like it can, you know, bother me. It can bother me while I'm at work. Um, sometimes I have to deal with something. I mean, it's intrusive on, yes, I'm monitoring, but yet on the other hand it can be really bothersome. You know, it can go off at any time and I could get a notice or maybe I get a notice that there's motion or something and I'm like, who is at my house? You know, just that whole security of not seeing it. But of course you can't see everything or control everything. But it's frequently bothered me at work or a notice on my phone where, you know, I needed to notify somebody or say say something and find out what's going on.

Speaker 1:          You don't like that this thing gets activated. Like for no reason or things like that, right?

Speaker 2:          No. I mean, guests come and go. They do what they are to do. So I'm being notified all day long or all night long or whatever and it can be increased intrusive onto my life. But I chose that so I can't say anything that is, is bad. If I didn't want this, then I just turned them off. But, so I chose this but he hadn't the other hand. It can be, it can be really frustrating and annoying sometimes it's not always, you don't always want to know.

Speaker 1:          Okay. Uh, so, uh, you are not sharing any like smart home devices until just search like for example, Google home, mini Alexa, things like that?

Speaker 2:          No, because you'd have to secure them in some way and having a lockbox or something so they wouldn't feel them. Yeah. How you'd have to do it. So I have absolutely thought of an echo or something like that too. But then that means you have to secure it in your house so that someone doesn't steal it. So no. Okay.

Speaker 1:          So mainly you want like something physically secure that monitors too,

Speaker 2:          that allows me to monitor and still be secured so that a guest doesn't feel it. But they can, I guess you could say have the luxury of using it. Sure. Like Google or an echo or something like that. Yeah, that'd be great. [inaudible] that's never been an option.

Speaker 1:          You don't have any like smart TV or anything?

Speaker 2:          Um, I have satellites in that house. I've been asked if I could get, um, like Netflix and I said that I would not pay for that. Um, and my thought was to put a Roku or like, you know, an echo or something to those lines and then they could sign it into a for themselves. Okay. But just like, like for example, a Roku onto a normal TV needs to be locked up because somebody can just walk out with it.

Speaker 1:          Makes sense.

Speaker 2:          So I did not do that. That guest did not end up booking and sign, never ended up doing any of that, but I looked into possibilities of what I could do to try to get them Netflix or something to those lines. In addition to, I already have satellite, just network. So, um, yeah. And then I ended up not doing anything. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          that's fine. So, um, can you share like any particular experience, um, you kind of avoided like a major on sun because you are using these devices,

Speaker 3:          huh?

Speaker 2:          Mmm [inaudible] I mean, nothing too big, but I have found as a guest left my thermostat set it 90 degrees. Mmm. Shortly after I, they checked out, um, the, I've found, um, the cameras. Aye. Let's see.

Speaker 3:          Okay.

Speaker 2:          I have, I have had a safety concern. Um, I had some of them my backyard and I caught them on camera and there was nobody supposed to be at my house. So, um, and that was in the middle of the night. And so that, and in the past have been, there was a crime, you know, nearby or whatever. So I followed up on that. Mmm.

Speaker 1:          Your candidate caught something?

Speaker 2:          I did. I did. I catch somebody who's in my backyard. Okay.

Speaker 1:          Oh, that's good. And, uh, the next question is kind of the opposite. Like, do you have any bad experiences because of this devices something major?

Speaker 2:          Mmm, I signed it would say that some bad experiences that I have found out about a lot of stuff that normally I wouldn't find out about, like, you know, guess lying or bringing more guests over or, um, you know, doing things they said they weren't going to do. And those kinds of things necessarily could be negative too because, um, anything bad for me, no. I am very happy. I didn't think I would in the beginning. Um, in the end I've been very happy and kind of changed my tune on, I didn't want to be that person with cameras, but in the end, I am very happy. Mmm. Just because I think my peace of mind is a fall because I don't live there. Yeah. Uh, normally I have a different sense of peace of mind that is huge for me, so, yeah. Okay.
