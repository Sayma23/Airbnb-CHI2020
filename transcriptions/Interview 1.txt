[00:00:00.300] 
This call is now being recorded. Hi.

[00:00:04.490] - Rajib
So what's the age thinking. Over 50. Okay. So which I do. Really. Which state to Hilton Head South Carolina. Good. So what. What does I do. Having neutral party I have the gates Smart Lock and I have Nest thermostat.

[00:00:30.880] 
So who installed them. You do.

[00:00:34.710] - Interviewee
I installed it myself.

[00:00:36.770] - Rajib
Okay good. Why did you use them to get to lock the gate lock.

[00:00:45.960] - Interviewee
The reason I use it is it has video so I know who comes and goes. It also lets me do what date in time PIN code that I send to people that has in store time and an in time so it expires so that they would only be able to access the unit during the dates and times I say. And the thermostat is because people have that. Tendency to go every which way with temperature and it's shit when nobody's there to go into a kind of mode to save money.

[00:01:19.470] - Interviewee
And also if people start getting ridiculous like I've seen a couple of people try and put it down to 65 when it's really hot out thermostats or air conditioners only make a difference of 20 degrees so you're all hang up the unit if you put it too low. So I kind of keep an eye that they don't cause it to freeze up.

[00:01:42.640] - Interviewee
I don't really have a problem with heat but to freeze up when it's too hot out the door so getting directly degree gate lock is on Wi-Fi and I have an app on my phone that I use to send a ping to the gas that's coming in. So how do you send the beam through the airport to the gate has an app and you put the phone number of the person if they have a phone.

[00:02:15.000] - Interviewee
If they have a landline then you have to manually send it through an email. If you don't have a cell number but if you have a cell number they get a text from a gate that says you know blah address. Here's the date and time it starts to use the date and time it ends and here's your PIN code.

[00:02:31.870] 
Okay. You have to use this indexing right.

[00:02:37.290] 
Only between the start and end times that you set up.

[00:02:41.140] - Rajib
Okay so how long you using those devices.

[00:02:45.950] 
Both of them for about nine months now which is how long this therapy that I have. Should the biggest thing we could do facing difficulties. Once in a while I'll get a difficulty with it hasn't been now but when I first got it because it's new a new company I had a problem with the updates not going into the device and kind of hanging it up.

[00:03:20.690] 
In the sense of sending new codes codes that were already on it refine it trying to send new codes. So I need them to send another update. I always.

[00:03:34.550] 
Send my codes a couple of days before but I have backup codes in case the new code didn't go after so guest contracted those devices.

[00:03:50.200] 
David they only interact to send firmware updates firmware through Bluebird because something you don't remember.

[00:04:07.660] 
That's what happened at one point that they did that but then they put the other update and everything's on the web side with it it's all web enabled. So when I said a user I.D. and a pin pin as the user I.D. they have it all on the web. So if the firmware does something then it can re initialize and then send over the values and get it.

[00:04:31.820] 
Why do you have that kind of access for the guest. From what I've written.

[00:04:38.100] 
Because it has video in it as well. So devices do runs on Wi-Fi smart app device. They have logs that we keep of all the videos that are on the web and they have the history of all the pins and allowing you to do so. I mean they haven't done it often but they have done it just like a bug connected to the Wi-Fi. Mean the search for the delays in finding is connected to the Wi-Fi.

[00:05:11.960] 
But it works with or without the Wi-Fi because it stores everything on the device the Wi-Fi is for the video to upload to the Internet.

[00:05:25.480] 
So for the video storage in contact with it rather than wait it uses Wi-Fi contact with that upload new passcode things like how did they actually define the mystery.

[00:05:44.520] 
I had alternate codes as well as I have a lockbox with the key in case the battery dies or something happens where it doesn't work at all. So I keep a backup of a lock box with the key. So I think those are the key answers if they need to but I've never had to use that.

[00:06:02.120] 
Used like when some guests actually used derisively known. How did they get there. Did the guests didn't do it.

[00:06:17.280] 
Gate Corporation sent a firm well not a not a guest. The company itself.

[00:06:25.690] 
The guest incorrectly as we know all they can do is enter a PIN they can hit a button because it has two way radio that can hit a button that looks like a telephone icon ring out to us. And if they have no problem we can actually let them in remotely as well. They can just enter the lock pin code to open and close the door.

[00:06:50.510] 
Okay awesome. So we want like any other good thing for the stripping from indirectly did you.

[00:07:03.230] 
I don't lock it out. I do allow them to adjust the temperature if I find somebody is just being unreasonable I will lock them out and only do it remotely.

[00:07:16.270] 
I've only had one guest out of 56. I'm reasonable and reasonable with almost everything. They just they're not somebody that should be doing your. Show.

[00:07:33.510] 
Do you want any other devices that you might want to share with the guest from Google or Alex or something like that.

[00:07:44.020] 
I don't want it to go home Alexa because I'm concerned about somebody setting up an account somebody else setting up an account and getting involved with anybody's personal information that they may have messed up. I do have it in my home but when I rent it in that other home I take it out because I just I'm afraid that they'll have access to things that they should be my main home I have the Google home and I have the TV and other stuff hooked up to it but I won't do that in the rental because I just don't want people enough to do that because there is no good option for them.

[00:08:26.400] 
That's pretty good.

[00:08:29.490] 
If they have that option like the Wi-Fi I would do it but I can't. So I do allow them to use Wi-Fi but it's their own devices so I'm not responsible for that. I don't want to leave something that I'm responsible for.

[00:08:44.750] 
For example the biggest thing that you have do want to do one thing make a specific feature of think everything that it gives me in the app is all that I need.

[00:08:58.450] 
And I don't want the guests to have any control over it at all. Victor I'm just looking good it they can input the code they can bring out to me instead of calling from their phone they can press the button and they'll call me and I can have a conversation with them if they're or if I see them having a problem with they're not answering the PIN code I can reach out to them and say Hi this is so and so far are you so-and-so. And they say they're not like them why are you trying to get in here yet.

[00:09:32.120] 
 I've had people go to the wrong unit at the wrong unit you're not renting this unit to this. That's why it isn't working.

[00:09:39.600] 
So I can get that two way conversation going so you're really really happy with the duties and I'm very happy with both of them. Yes.

[00:09:50.650] 
Awesome.

[00:09:53.560] 
So do you want to share your experiences that you had Major if you don't like your dad using these devices.

[00:10:06.130] 
I would. I would share that we had a hurricane down here. During the hurricane.

[00:10:11.660] 
Having the gate in there and we were able to because the video and the pins were able to know when the people were at the place and I was able to reach out to them and give them advice with regards to evacuation orders and stuff. So it was good. I knew they were there and I knew how many people were there. And I think it's a good experience to know that because the videos on entry and exit I don't feel insecure about somebody potentially ransacking my place. So we've got the video plus the date time stamp and it was won by the Kinko's.

[00:10:50.350] 
 So I just feel like I have a little bit more security. I am in a gated community with security and that's the other thing. They had an emergency situation. They were able to reach out to me I could see it with security and give them access. It wasn't anything bad it was just they were checking during the hurricane. So I think that's good. The ability to do that even though we didn't have electric battery operated it was up and running from your Wi-Fi for them to reach me to get me a dial that anyway.

[00:11:28.180] 
But you have to change your battery.

[00:11:32.520] 
It's a rechargeable batteries that's on the back of the unit. So when I clean I just throw it in the charger every night not every cleaning but every so often and it gives me where the battery life is that know one time I needed to ask I guess the third and the battery because I wasn't around for the charger.

[00:11:52.750] 
And they they were fine with that to Okay that's good. So I didn't think I had any more questions so I stopped the recorder and can continue the conversation.
